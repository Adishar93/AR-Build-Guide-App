# AR Build Guide App
User Interface and data access (Firebase) code for the Augmented Reality Application aimed at helping with manual assembly of 
products / machinery by projecting a virtual model on a flat surface 
(like table or floor) with step by step assembly animations.

This repository has code for Android UI implementation using Android SDK and model data fetching from Realtime Firebase Database.
